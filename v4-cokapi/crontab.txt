# Docker tends to eat up resources such as memory, etc., which will
# grind the machine to a halt. Here's an example crontab that, every 30
# minutes, kills all docker processes so that we hopefully don't
# overload the system. it also reboots the entire machine periodically
# to flush everything out.
