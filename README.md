Online Python Tutor -- http://pythontutor.com/ -- helps people overcome
a fundamental barrier to learning programming: understanding what
happens as the computer executes each line of a program's source code.
Using this tool, you can write Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript,
Ruby, C, and C++ programs in your Web browser and visualize what the
computer is doing step-by-step as it executes those programs.

All documentation is viewable online at:
https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/tree/master/v3/docs

https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/
The v3/ sub-directory contains the latest version of the frontend code.
